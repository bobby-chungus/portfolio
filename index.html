    <h2>Hello</h2>
   <p>My name is T.J. and thank you for visiting my portfolio. Here you will find 
     information about my experience, skills, projects.</p>
   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>My adventures into web development, networking, and IT troubleshooting began with a
     childhood curioisty. Like most 90's kids, I grew up sharing a desktop machine with my 
     family and learned how to keep it alive out of pure neccesity. I taught myself HTML/CSS, 
     created websites, and maintained a healthy interest in technology throughout high school.
     After graduation in 2006, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served as Tactical Air Control
     Party Specialist from 2007-2011.
